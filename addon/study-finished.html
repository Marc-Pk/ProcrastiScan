    <h2>Study Finished ðŸŽ‰</h2>
        <p>Thank you for testing ProcrastiScan! Your participation is highly appreciated and will be helpful in researching digital wellbeing tools. </p>
        <p>
        If you stated your e-mail in the setup process and made it this far, you are now included in the raffle for the study award. In case you're one of the winners, you will be contacted in the following weeks. You can now remove this extension, the python server and especially if you're tired of all the self report prompts. If you wish to continue using the extension, it will likely be updated by late July as a non-study version. If you keep using it now, you will still see the self-report prompts, but no further data will be collected or sent. Interventions won't be triggered automatically. Follow the <a href="https://github.com/Marc-Pk/ProcrastiScan" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for updates.
        </p>

        <p>Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:procrastiscan@gmail.com">procrastiscan@gmail.com</a> for further questions or feedback regarding the study or its results.</p>
